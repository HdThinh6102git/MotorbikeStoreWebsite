# MotorbikeStore - E-commerce website built with java (jsp/servlet), html/css (boostrap), jdbc, mysql

## Introduction

Here is my source code for building an e-commerce website used to introduce and sell motorbike of a store. 
After studying web programming course in my university, my group and me really wanted to build a web application to apply our knowledge in a real project in order to understand more about web programming and try building an efficient project for customers who are in need. We did several research for many topics and we realized that many motorbike stores have not had their own website but they seem to have demand on this technology so we want to build this website for those customers as well as to help them introduce their products visually and promote sales. We not only applied web programming knowledge on this project but also continued to update with some web security, some design patterns,... And now I'm in the progress of updating this to enhance the project to be better and more effective.
